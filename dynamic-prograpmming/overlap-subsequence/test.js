// overlap subsequence
// Write a function, overlapSubsequence, that takes in two strings as arguments.
// The function should return the length of the longest overlapping subsequence.

// A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string,
// while maintaining the relative order of characters.

// overlapSubsequence("dogs", "daogt"); // -> 3
// overlapSubsequence("xcyats", "criaotsi"); // -> 4
// overlapSubsequence("xfeqortsver", "feeeuavoeqr"); // -> 5
// overlapSubsequence("kinfolklivemustache", "bespokekinfolksnackwave"); // -> 11
// overlapSubsequence(
//   "mumblecorebeardleggingsauthenticunicorn",
//   "succulentspughumblemeditationlocavore"
// ); // -> 15
